# Magento Playwright Automation

This project contains automated tests for a Magento-based e-commerce website, written using Playwright.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Can-Kizilay/magento-automation.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd magento-automation
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Install Playwright browsers:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install
    ```

## Running the tests

To run the end-to-end tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the Playwright tests and generate a report.

## Tests

The tests are located in the `tests` directory. Each test file corresponds to a specific feature or functionality of the Magento website.
Test steps are organized using Playwright's `test.step` method to provide better readability and reporting.

## Reporting

Test results can be viewed in the HTML report generated by Playwright.
To generate the report, run the following command:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Test Data

The test data is stored in the `tests/data` directory.
You can modify the JSON files to change the products and their attributes used in the tests.

## Fixtures

Fixtures are defined in the `tests/fixtures` directory.
Fixtures are used to set up the page objects and other reusable components for the tests.

## Page Objects

Page objects are defined in the `pages` directory.
Each page object represents a specific page or component of the Magento website and contains methods to interact with the page elements.

## Dependencies

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/): For browser automation and end-to-end testing.
- [@faker-js/faker](https://fakerjs.dev/): For generating fake data for testing.
